# Introduction

Pdfmake-wrapper is a wrapper based on [pdfmake](http://pdfmake.org), but it provides type support that helps to generate PDF documents in an easy and readable way.

## Motivation

Using pure pdfmake library can be a bit tedious and messy when reading/writing code, since it works using literal objects. Pdfmake-wrapper was created with type compatibility in mind, that's why it was built in Typescript which helps to write code quickly thanks to autocompletion and easy to read thanks to named objects/instances.

## Features

- Type compatibility
- Client and server side development
- Working with multiple and custom fonts
- Icons support
- Adding Images from URL (base64 is originally supported)
- Drawing shapes (Lines, Rects, etc...)
- QR code
- Tables

and more.
